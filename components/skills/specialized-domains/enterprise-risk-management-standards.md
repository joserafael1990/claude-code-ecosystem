# Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Standards

This skill outlines the standards for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating risks across financial, operational, and strategic domains.

## Risk Governance & Frameworks
- **Three Lines of Defense**:
    1.  **Operational Management**: Owns and manages risks (First Line).
    2.  **Risk Management Function**: Oversights and sets policies (Second Line).
    3.  **Internal Audit**: Independent assurance (Third Line).
- **RCSA (Risk and Control Self-Assessment)**: Conduct quarterly RCSAs to map business processes to risks and evaluate control effectiveness.
- **Risk Appetite**: Define clear Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) with Amber/Red thresholds. Breaches must trigger immediate escalation.

## Quantitative Risk Modeling
- **Market Risk**: Use Value at Risk (VaR) (99% confidence, 10-day horizon) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for tail risk measurement.
- **Credit Risk**: Model Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD) to calculate Expected Credit Loss (ECL) under IFRS 9/CECL.
- **Model Validation**: Independent validation of all risk models. Check for overfitting, conceptual soundness, and data integrity.

## Operational & Cyber Risk
- **Business Continuity**: Maintain and test Business Continuity Plans (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) plans annually. Target RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).
- **Vendor Risk**: Tier third-party vendors based on data access and criticality. Enforce SOC 2 Type II or ISO 27001 compliance for critical vendors.
- **Cyber Resilience**: Integrate with ISO 27001/NIST frameworks. Quantify cyber risk impact using FAIR methodology if possible.

## Stress Testing
- **Scenario Analysis**: Run stress tests against historical scenarios (e.g., 2008 Financial Crisis, COVID-19) and hypothetical "Black Swan" events.
- **Reverse Stress Testing**: Identify scenarios that would render the business model unviable (break the bank) to understand vulnerabilities.
- **Capital Adequacy**: Ensure capital buffers meets regulatory requirements (Basel III, Solvency II) under stressed conditions.
