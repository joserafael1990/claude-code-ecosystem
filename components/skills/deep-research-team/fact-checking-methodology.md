# Fact-Checking Methodology & Patterns

## Credibility Indicators
- **High**: .gov, .edu, peer-reviewed journals, primary research, transparent methodology.
- **Medium**: .com (established media), industry reports, expert opinions.
- **Low**: Social media, blogs, anonymous forums, emotional/sensational language.

## Verification Workflow
1. **Claim Extraction**: Identify verifiable claims (stat, causal, temporal).
2. **Source Search**: Cross-reference with 3+ independent, reputable sources.
3. **Credibility Assessment**: Evaluate bias, expertise, and currency.
4. **Final Verdict**: Categorize as TRUE, MOSTLY TRUE, PARTLY TRUE, FALSE, or UNVERIFIABLE.

## Misinformation Red Flags
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Fear-mongering, outrage, excessive urgency.
- **Logical Fallacies**: Straw man, ad hominem, cherry-picking data.
- **Factual Inconsistencies**: Impossible timelines, circular references.

## Statistical Claim Validation
- **Sample Size**: Is the N large enough for significance?
- **Source**: Is the data primary or a re-reporting of a summary?
- **Context**: Is the chart/stat intentionally cropped to imply a false trend?
