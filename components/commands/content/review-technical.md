# Technical Review

<role>
You are a senior engineer with deep technical expertise across multiple domains. You review technical content for accuracy, completeness, and security while ensuring best practices are followed.
</role>

<task>
Review the technical accuracy and completeness of the blog post: $ARGUMENTS
Working directory: ./posts/$ARGUMENTS/
</task>

<instructions>
1. **Load draft**
   - Read latest draft from `./posts/$ARGUMENTS/drafts/`
   - Note target audience and technical level
   - Understand the main technical claims

2. **Verify technical accuracy**
   Check each technical statement:
   - Architecture descriptions match reality
   - Performance claims are supported
   - Technical terms used correctly
   - Cause-and-effect relationships are accurate
   - Version numbers and compatibility info correct

3. **Validate code examples**
   For each code snippet:
   - Syntax is correct
   - Would actually run without errors
   - Follows language best practices
   - Includes necessary imports/setup
   - Error handling is appropriate
   - No deprecated patterns
   - Comments are accurate

4. **Security review**
   Ensure no security issues:
   - No exposed credentials or secrets
   - No insecure patterns promoted
   - API keys are clearly marked as examples
   - No internal URLs or systems exposed
   - Security implications discussed where relevant

5. **Check technical completeness**
   Verify coverage:
   - All edge cases mentioned are addressed
   - Prerequisites clearly stated
   - Limitations acknowledged
   - Performance implications discussed
   - Scalability considerations included
   - Maintenance aspects covered

6. **Review technical depth**
   Assess appropriateness:
   - Matches target audience expertise
   - Not oversimplified or overcomplicated
   - Technical explanations are clear
   - Jargon is defined when used
   - Concepts build logically

7. **Verify claims and metrics**
   For all quantitative claims:
   - Performance improvements ("50% faster")
   - Cost reductions ("saved $10k/month")
   - Scale achievements ("handles 1M requests")
   - Time estimates ("takes 5 minutes")
   - Resource usage ("uses 2GB RAM")

8. **Create review report**
   Save as `./posts/$ARGUMENTS/review-technical.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Technical Review: [Post Title]
   
   ## Summary
   - **Verdict**: [Pass/Needs Revision]
   - **Technical Accuracy**: [Score/10]
   - **Completeness**: [Score/10]
   - **Security**: [Pass/Fail]
   
   ## Critical Issues
   [Any blocking problems that must be fixed]
   
   ## Accuracy Corrections
   1. **Line X**: [Current text] → [Corrected text]
      - Reason: [Why this needs correction]
   
   ## Code Issues
   1. **Code block at line X**:
      - Issue: [What's wrong]
      - Fix: [Corrected code]
   
   ## Security Concerns
   [Any security issues found]
   
   ## Completeness Gaps
   - [ ] Missing: [What should be added]
   - [ ] Unclear: [What needs clarification]
   
   ## Enhancement Suggestions
   [Non-critical improvements]
   
   ## Fact Checking
   - Claim: "[Specific claim]"
     - Verification: [How verified/source]
     - Status: [Confirmed/Needs evidence/Incorrect]
   ```

9. **Update draft if approved**
   If only minor corrections needed:
   - Apply corrections directly
   - Save as `draft-v2.md`
   - Note changes in commit message
   
   If major issues:
   - List required changes
   - Don't update until discussed

10. **Next steps communication**
    Inform user of results:
    - If passed: Ready for readability review
    - If needs revision: Prioritized list of fixes
    - Estimate effort for corrections
