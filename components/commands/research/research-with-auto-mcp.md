# Smart Research with MCP Auto-Detection

You want me to research: $ARGUMENTS

## Auto-Detection Strategy

I'll analyze your request and automatically use the most relevant MCPs:

**Library/Framework Research:**
- **If your request contains library/framework names** → Use Context7 MCP for official docs
- **If you need deep technical documentation** → Use mcp-deepwiki for comprehensive info
- **If you mention books or publications** → Use open-library MCP for references

**API & Integration:**
- **If you mention "API" or "OpenAPI"** → Check reapi-mcp-openapi for existing specs
- **If you mention "Supabase" or database** → Use Supabase MCP for project data

**Design & UI:**
- **If you mention "design", "UI", or "mockup"** → Use Figma MCP for design system patterns

**Testing & Automation:**
- **If you mention "testing", "E2E", or "automation"** → Use Playwright MCP for browser testing
- **If you need browser interaction** → Use browser-tools MCP for web automation

**Documentation & Knowledge:**
- **If you mention "Notion" or "documentation"** → Use Notion API MCP for team knowledge
- **If you mention "Slack" or "team communication"** → Use Slack MCP for team context
- **If you have complex documents to parse** → Use markitdown MCP for conversion

**Media & Content:**
- **If you mention "YouTube" or "video transcript"** → Use youtube-transcript MCP
- **If you mention "marketing" or "strategy"** → Use osp_marketing_tools MCP

## Research Process

1. **Primary Research**: Use the most relevant MCP based on auto-detection
2. **Cross-Reference**: Use additional MCPs if the topic spans multiple areas  
3. **Verification**: Cross-check findings across sources
4. **Documentation**: Provide clear citations and confidence levels

## Evidence Requirements

Every response will include:
- **Source**: Which MCP(s) provided the information
- **Confidence**: How certain I am about the recommendation (0-100%)
- **Alternatives**: Other approaches I considered
- **Next Steps**: Specific actions you can take

Let me start by analyzing your request for relevant patterns...
