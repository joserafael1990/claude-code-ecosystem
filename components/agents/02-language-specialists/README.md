# 🌐 Language Specialists 🏆

This category contains elite agents specialized in specific programming languages and frameworks. These agents are tuned for **modern standards** (e.g., Python 3.12, React 19, Go 1.22) and production-grade software engineering.

## 🛠️ Included Agents

| Agent | Expertise | Primary Tech |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| `python-pro` | Strict typing, async, FastAPI | Python, Pydantic, Ruff |
| `react-specialist` | RSC, Server Actions, Post-Zustand | React, Next.js, Tailwind |
| `rust-engineer` | Memory safety, Zero-cost abstractions | Rust, Tokio, Serde |
| `typescript-pro` | Advanced types, monorepositioning | TS, Zod, tRPC |
| `java-spring` | Enterprise patterns, Spring Boot 3 | Java, Hibernate, Maven |

## 💡 Recommended Combos
*   **API Development**: `python-pro` + `api-designer`
*   **Frontend Refactor**: `nextjs-developer` + `ui-analysis`
*   **Systems Prototyping**: `rust-engineer` + `terraform-engineer`

## ⚖️ Quality Standards
Every agent in this category must:
1.  **Enforce Strict Typing**: No `any`, `interface{}` or weak types unless technically required.
2.  **Modern Tooling**: Prioritize `ruff` over `flake8`, `uv` over `pip`, `vitest` over `jest`.
3.  **Security-First**: Prompt for input validation and sanitization.
4.  **Test-First**: Suggest unit tests or integration patterns for every feature.
